Cryptography Learning Project: SHA-256 and SHA-3 Implementations

This repository contains my personal implementation of cryptographic hash functions SHA-256 and SHA-3, written in both Python and C. The purpose of these implementations is to deepen my understanding of cryptographic algorithms and provide hands-on experience with hashing and the internal workings of SHA algorithms.
